# Predicting-customer-churn-using-machine-learning-to-uncover-hidden-patterns Sure!

## **Problem Statement**

Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, particularly in subscription-based industries such as telecommunications, banking, SaaS, and retail. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. However, businesses often struggle to identify which customers are at risk of leaving before it’s too late. This project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify customers who are likely to churn. By uncovering hidden patterns in customer behavior, the model will help businesses take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Understand customer churn** by analyzing historical customer behavior and transaction data.
2. **Identify key factors** that contribute to customer churn using statistical and machine learning methods.
3. **Build and evaluate machine learning models** to predict the likelihood of churn for each customer.
4. **Uncover hidden patterns and insights** using exploratory data analysis and feature importance techniques.
5. **Provide actionable recommendations** for retention strategies based on the model's output.

## **Data Description**

The dataset typically includes the following types of features:

* **Customer Demographics:**

  * Gender
  * Age
  * Region
  * Income level

* **Account Information:**

  * Tenure
  * Type of service plan
  * Billing method (electronic/paper)
  * Payment method

* **Service Usage:**

  * Number of calls
  * Internet usage (MB/GB)
  * Customer service calls

* **Contract and Subscription Data:**

  * Contract length (monthly, yearly)
  * Automatic renewal status
  * Promotions availed

* **Target Variable:**

  * Churn (Yes/No or 1/0)

---

## **Data Preprocessing (Elaborated)**

1. **Data Cleaning:**

   * Handle missing values:

     * Numerical: Impute with mean/median.
     * Categorical: Impute with mode or “Unknown”.
   * Remove duplicate entries.

2. **Data Transformation:**

   * Encode categorical variables:

     * Label Encoding for binary categories.
     * One-Hot Encoding for multi-class categories.
   * Normalize or standardize numerical features if required (e.g., for distance-based models like KNN or SVM).

3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**

   * Use Z-score or IQR method to detect and cap/floor outliers.

4. **Feature Engineering:**

   * Create new features such as:

     * Customer engagement score (based on service usage)
     * Interaction frequency
     * Days since last interaction
   * Date/time transformations if any (e.g., account age).

5. **Train-Test Split:**

   * Divide data into training and testing sets (typically 80/20 or 70/30).
   * Use stratified sampling if the target variable is imbalanced.

6. **Handling Class Imbalance:**

   * Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or class weighting.

7. **Feature Selection/Reduction:**

   * Remove redundant features using correlation matrix.
   * Use feature importance from models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) or Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
